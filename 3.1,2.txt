#3.1 Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of products and a target product name as input. The function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of indices of all occurrences of the product if found, or an empty list if the product is not found.
def linear_search_product(product_list, target_product):
    indices = []
    for i, product in enumerate(product_list):
        if product == target_product:
            indices.append(i)
    return indices

# Example usage:
products = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple"]
target = "apple"
result = linear_search_product(products, target)
if result:
    print(f"The product '{target}' was found at indices: {result}")
else:
    print(f"The product '{target}' was not found in the list.")

#3.2 Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.cgpa = cgpa

def sort_students(student_list):
    sorted_students = sorted(student_list, key=lambda student: student.cgpa, reverse=True)
    return sorted_students

# Example usage:
student1 = Student("Alice", "S123", 3.7)
student2 = Student("Bob", "S124", 3.9)
student3 = Student("Charlie", "S125", 3.5)
student4 = Student("David", "S126", 3.8)

students = [student1, student2, student3, student4]

sorted_students = sort_students(students)

# Print the sorted list of students by CGPA in descending order
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, CGPA: {student.cgpa}")
